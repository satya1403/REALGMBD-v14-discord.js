Hello there 
This is the owner of the template... 
If you dont know js this is the games folder.. 
You need to copy the code in the games folder then put that in the create.js file 
Where to put it in? well here is the code you need to insert 
```
        {
         label: 'Snake.io'
          , value: 'Snake.io'

        }, 
        {
         label: 'Putch ball'
         , value: 'Putchball'

        } 
      ```
        into here
```
        {
          label: 'Rock Paper Scissors',
          value: 'rps',
        },
        {
          label: 'Tic-Tac-Toe',
          value: 'tictactoe',
        },
        {
          label: 'Wordle',
          value: 'wordle',
        }, 
  ```
        and which should look alike something like this
```
        {
          label: 'Rock Paper Scissors',
          value: 'rps',
        },
        {
          label: 'Tic-Tac-Toe',
          value: 'tictactoe',
        },
        {
          label: 'Wordle',
          value: 'wordle',
        },
        {
         label: 'Snake.io'
          , value: 'Snake.io'

        }, 
        {
         label: 'Putch ball'
         , value: 'Putchball'

        }
      ]);
      ```

      Make sure to remove the backstick key which is this ``` 
      otherwise it could lead to a lot of error codes 
Disclamer: You need to put the first code into the second code that was shown in the create.js file

Now lets add the complete game mode by adding this
